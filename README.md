To run the application ,clone this repo and install the dependencies. Once you are done with that,you need to have your own TMDB API key,make a .env file in the src folder and paste REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY ="your api key"
Now just run the application.
P.S. for some reasons ,this and neither the deployed websites are return queries,but my on my phone,it works...
